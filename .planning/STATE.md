# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-28)

**Core value:** The daily habit loop keeps you opening the app, and every part of your lifestyle gets the right kind of structure (check/status/position/stem/promote) filed in one opinionated place.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Domain Generalization (A)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Domain Generalization (A)) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 6
Status: Executing Phase 1
Last activity: 2026-06-28 -- Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (Wave-0 validation scaffold)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 12 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1 | 12 min | 12 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (12 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (12 locked-intent decisions carried from the SPEC).
Most relevant to current work (Phase 1):

- DEC-domains-chosen-set: Domain generalizes Category (generalization, not a rewrite); each domain has an SF Symbol + color token.
- DEC-additive-migration-only: plan-less inferred migration; renames only via `@Attribute(originalName:)`; NEVER add `migrationPlan:`.
- DEC-four-tabs: keep 4 tabs (Today, Hub, Progress, Settings); Hub is the offshoot home.
- DEC-today-is-hero: Today stays pure and visually unchanged; offshoots live under Hub.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Open questions to resolve before/within their phase (from PROJECT.md Open Questions):

- Q2 (before Phase 1): Category→Domain — relabel-only vs `@Attribute(originalName:)`. Migration-plan path is struck.
- Q3 (before Phase 1): Seed reconciliation for existing users (auto-focus existing categories? push new seed into populated installs vs fresh-install-only? re-seed policy vs seedVersion).
- Q1 (before Phase 4): Clip previews vs offline-only (default: fully offline).

Pre-existing owner-side BLOCKER (not a planning blocker): local Xcode/TestFlight verification is required on the user's side. Plan status: SPEC is "planning only — not approved to build."

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Widgets | WidgetKit widgets (WDGT-01) | Deferred to post-Phase 6 | Roadmap bootstrap |
